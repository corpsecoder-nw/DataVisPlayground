This is an interactive map of the United States with a poverty level line plot overlayed in the middle for comparison of poverty rates between states. Feel free to add to it. I honestly wish the visitors of this repository could help upgrade this so that unnecessary lines and points could be removed without removing the entire plot for selective comparisons based on particular transitions. This is a work in progress and kind of a reflection of my semi-amateurish skills with D3.js. But I hope it is an insightful graphic.

For those interested in the data, well I've included it and it only goes from 2012-2021.

In order to use it, pull from the repo obviously, in VSCode it's an easy one where you just run ```python3 -m http.server 8000``` in the terminal, in the same directory as the one you pulled the repo into. Then open Chrome or whatever and go to "localhost:8000". You should be able to see the plain map. Then click on a state to see it's poverty rate trend from 2012-2021. To compare, click on another state. If the state you wish to compare with is not a neighboring state of the one you initially clicked on, then click on the initial state again to zoom-out and then click on the state you wish to compare the 1st one to.

Also for further project ideas or requests that you want me to livestream on Twitch, let me know through my Instagram: @corpsecoder_ or @corpsecoder_nw. To let me know when I'm streaming, visit my Twitch stream: @corpsecoder_nw.
